# Alzheimer-s_Prediction

 #  **Introduction**

**Technology towards the Health domain is a rigorous demand due to the inhabitant growth. As Health Catalyst, analyze data related to real-time predictions to physicians in Electronic Records and medical practitioners to aid clinical decision making. Due to its Broad range of machine learning applications like Disease Identification.In Medicals, Chronic disease is a dreadful attack for the individuals which persists for a long duration, and today, the number can double and has never been treated **
**
**Artificial Intelligence encompasses advanced Techniques like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Representation Learning which are known as expert systems in dealing with Classification, Risk Assessment, Segmentation, Diagnosing, prognosis, and even in Prediction at earlier**

# Background 

Alzheimer’s varies from usual cerebral aging. Healthy aging shrinks a nanoscopic brain portion but doesn't impair nerve cells.The irreversible atrophy is found in the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary segments

A standard medical approach for the Alzheimer’s is highly necessitates. MRI Scanning detects patterns that will clearly distinguish AD subjects from healthy controls (HCs) and describe the dissimilarity among Mild Cognitive Impairment subjects and HCs

# Who
Most adults were prone to this situation which makes brain cells deteriorate and flush out, eventually crumble many other areas. As it long progresses, the individual loses one’s ability to reside and function. No meditation can treat or no less than lags the malady progression. At a juncture, the valetudinarian agonizes dehydration, malnutrition, or infection and sometimes may end the life. Diagnosing Brain Functions and contemplate Dementia is entailing else the rate mounts to 125 million ailings by 2050. Predicting Alzheimer’s also strenuous due to its uncertainty.

 # What
 
 ‘ALZHEIMER DEMENTIA’ is considerable. Dementia is a well-known cognitive intellectual impairment neurodegenerative ailment
 
 # Why
AD deplete neuron and its connection in evocation, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and rearmost cerebral cortex which is the outer (grey wrinkled) casing of cerebrum. The irreversible atrophy is found in the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary segments. High level proteins in the fluid is also injurious to the brain, Amyloid (protein clump) plaques bind and damage nerve synapses (where it affects nerves) leading to memory loss as the early sign of AD.

# Where
Conventionally Cerebrum, cerebellum and Brain stem responsible in the control of memory, coordination and automatic functioning respectively, AD deplete neuron and its connection in evocation, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and rearmost cerebral cortex which is the outer (grey wrinkled) casing of cerebrum.

# How
Early Detection can be possible using advance computersied Techqiues which are used in the space and other challenging Domains using Object Detection. The MRI Images are fed to Machine learning Algorithms.
