# Alzheimer-s_Prediction

 #  **Introduction**

**Technology towards the Health domain is a rigorous demand due to the inhabitant growth. As Health Catalyst, analyze data related to real-time predictions to physicians in Electronic Records and medical practitioners to aid clinical decision making. Due to its Broad range of machine learning applications like Disease Identification.**

**Artificial Intelligence encompasses advanced Techniques like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Representation Learning which are known as expert systems in dealing with Classification, Risk Assessment, Segmentation, Diagnosing, prognosis, and even in Prediction at earlier
**

# Background 

**Alzheimerâ€™s varies from usual cerebral aging. Healthy aging shrinks a nanoscopic brain portion but doesn't impair nerve cells.The irreversible atrophy is found in the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary segments**
